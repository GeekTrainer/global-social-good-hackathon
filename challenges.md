# Potential challenges

Each challenge suggestion is built to meet the judging criteria, and offer room for to ideate and innovate. These challenges are designed so teams can complete them within the allotted time. Resources are provided to give your team a jump start, and improve your team's chance for success!

Your team is free to build upon the suggestions, create new requirements, or use a challenge as a starting point for a completely different project. This is your team's hack!

If your team isn't sure if a project idea meets the criteria or has any other questions, **please ask**!

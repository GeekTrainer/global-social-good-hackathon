# HTML Accessibility Checker

## Challenge

Many web developers are unfamiliar with the guidelines for creating a [accessible web page](https://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills-web-developers). The two most common mistakes are [missing alt text](https://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills/alt-text) and [poor link text](https://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills/hyperlinks). Having good alt and link text is essential to creating an accessible page.

## Opportunities

Your team can create a web based tool a user could use to upload an HTML file or specify a URL to ensure the page meets the accessibility criteria. Because the most common errors are missing `alt` attributes or links using text such as *here* or *click here*. Any issues found by the tool would be displayed by the page, or a friendly success message if no issues are found.

Your team could also grow the application to crawl an entire site and offer a full report of all issues found. Additional checks for JavaScript or other accessibility errors could also be added.

# HTML Accessibility Checker

## Overview

Many web developers are unfamiliar with the guidelines for creating a [accessible web page](https://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills-web-developers). The two most common mistakes are [missing alt text](https://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills/alt-text) and [poor link text](https://accessibility.umn.edu/core-skills/hyperlinks). Having good alt and link text is essential to creating an accessible page.

## Success criteria

Your team will create a web based tool a user could use to upload an HTML file to ensure it meets the following criteria:

- All images contain an `alt` attribute
- No links use text such as *here* or *click here*

Any issues found by the tool should be displayed by the page, or a friendly success message if no issues are found.

### Team formation

We will be creating ten teams. With 60 total participants expected, this means teams should contain six members. Should there be an odd number, some teams of five will be formed.

You are free to form teams however you see fit as long as there are ten total teams. You can meet new friends, or work with a pre-existing team.

### Project requirements

- At the end of the day your team will be delivering a **five minute** presentation which meets these criteria
  - At most two slides to highlight the architecture and technologies
  - Demonstrates the application
  - No videos or other external media
- The project needs to incorporate Azure or other Microsoft products, such as
  - App Services
  - Bot Services
  - Cognitive Services
  - Databases
  - Internet of Things
  - Machine Learning Services
  - Virtual Machines
- The project needs to serve social good or the betterment of others

### Presentations and judging

At the end of the available hacking time, each team will have one or more representative deliver a five minute presentation on their team's project. The goal of the presentation is to highlight what your team built, how the solution works, and what your team is most proud of. Your team is free to use slides or other presentation media, or to focus solely on the solution your team built.

Presentation order will be determined by random selection. Teams will be informed of the presentation order at 15:50, 10 minutes before presentations begin. Once presentations begin at 16:00, all development must end.

Teams will be scored on

- Creativity: Did your team go beyond the scope of the challenge? Did your team create new solutions for existing problems?
- Project completeness: How well does the solution or application work?
- Use of Azure: Were available technologies used correctly, and how well was Azure incorporated into the project?

## Hack notes

### Tips and tricks

Remember the goal is to create a working solution as a team. With the short amount of time available, this will only be accomplished if your team works as a team. Divide and conquer the work. Lean on people's strengths. Get everyone involved, and listen to all ideas.

### Suggested challenges

While your team is free to come up with their own idea, there is a **limited amount of time** available for hacking. As a result, your team is strongly encouraged to choose one of the challenges suggested below. Each challenge includes a set of resources to help jump start development and improve your team's chances for success. Remember, your team is required to present the solution at the end of the day, with the expectation a working proof of concept will be completed.

If your team does decide to create their own project, it must follow meet the following criteria

- **All code** and other resources must be created during the event; no existing work from the team can be used during the hack event
- The project must focus on social good or the betterment of others

To help your team succeed, a collection of [challenges](./challenges.md) have been created.
